## The Mary Celeste (1872), Found Sailing Fully Stocked, No Crew

She was found abandoned, a silent ghost drifting through the Atlantic, the sea itself holding her secrets.

The Mary Celeste, a silver‑lined brigantine (2-masted sailing ship) that vanished without a
trace, has been haunting maritime lore for over a century. When she was discovered on November 7, 1872, the ship was in pristine condition, fully stocked with provisions, and, most chillingly, her crew were nowhere to be found. The mystery has spawned countless theories, from piracy to supernatural forces, and continues to inspire books, films, and scholarly debate.

TL;DR: The Mary Celeste was found abandoned in 1872. No crew. Theories
abound. Still unsolved.

The Mary Celeste was found fully stocked—every hold, galley, and locker
brimming with goods:

- Food & Drink: Salted pork, hardtack, wine, beer, and fresh fruit.
- Aft: A well‑filled store of provisions that would have lasted a crew for
months.
- Equipment: A full rigging set, fresh sails, and the ship’s navigation
instruments were in working order.
- The ship’s logbook, in pristine condition, contained entries up until
mid‑October 1872. The captain’s final note: “We are at sea. No weather
warning,” was the last recorded entry. No other documentation, like a crew
list, was found.
